# GDPR Knowledge Base
In this section, you will find information regarding what GDPR is about and what are some of the key information you will need to support your projects.

## Scope
GDPR applies to companies collecting and processing an EU citizen personal data. One might think that this means only EU companies are affected; this however is not true. GDPR also applies to foreign companies collecting and processing EU personal data for any EU citizen who is legally residing in an EU member state. Thus it also applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. So for example, a company using cloud solutions would be affected.

Unlike the directive that it replaces, GDPR is a regulation which means that it is automatically enforceable in member nations with the local authorities having to enact their own local legislation.

## Breach Notification and Penalites
Breach notification must be done with-in 72 hours of discovery. The notification must be issued to both customers and the local DPA​​.
* Max fine:  4% of annual global turnover or €20million
* Tiered approach e.g. 2% for minimal violation
* Max fine imposed on most serious infractions
* Applies to data controllers and processors
