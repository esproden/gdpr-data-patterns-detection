# What is Personal Data?
The GDPR does define what personal data is with-in Article 4 and thru Recitals 15,26,28,29,30,31,34,35,36,37. To be precise the definition is:
> ‘***personal data***’ means **any information** relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘*data subject*’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person

To get an extended clarification of personal data, reading the recitals is important. The recitals expand greatly on the various factors that can be interpreted as personal data and thus used to identify a data subject.

The GDPR also introduces the concept that some personal data is more sensitive and thus more restrictive in terms of processing than other types.
